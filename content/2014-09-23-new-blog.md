Title: New blog

I finally took the time to update my Wordpress blog and make it static. Having a PHP-based website in 2014 felt archaic. The new site is generated with Pelican, a great Python-based static blog generator.

I'm very glad I chose Pelican. It's a really great tool. It doesn't get in my way. It's highly customizable, being based on the fantastic Jinja templating system. Highly recommended.
