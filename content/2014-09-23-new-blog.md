Title: New blog

I finally took the time to update my Wordpress blog and make it static. Having a PHP-based website in 2014 felt archaic. The new site is generated with Pelican, a great Python-based static blog generator.

Pelican is great. It doesn't get in my way, it's highly customizable, and it works with Markdown out of the box.

Previously, I had a home-made solution that was not very convenient. I would wrote a post in Markdown and convert it to HTML thanks to a custom Python script (calling pandoc under the hood). Then, I had to copy-paste the HTML code to Wordpress.

Now, I can write my blog posts in Markdown and generate the entire website with Pelican. Then I just have to push the generated HTML pages on GitHub.

I found some plugins to add support for LaTeX equations (rendered with MathJax) and IPython notebooks.
