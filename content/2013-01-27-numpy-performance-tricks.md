Title: Numpy performance tricks

I've been using Numpy for nearly five years, but I'm still learning
performance tricks. The reason is that I currently need to deal with
very large arrays (hundreds of millions of elements) and the performance
of my code started to be disappointing. Then, through extensive
line-by-line profiling, I discovered some subtleties that explain why
some seemingly harmless lines of code can actually lead to major
bottlenecks. Very often, a small trick allows to significantly improve
the performance. Here is what I've learnt. These tips are intended to
regular Numpy users rather than pure beginners.
