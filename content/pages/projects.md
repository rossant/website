## Platform for large-scale electrophysiological data analysis

Next-generation electrophysiological recording devices require scalable data analysis platforms. I'm leading the development of a new Python-based platform that will let scientists analyze their terabytes of data remotely and effectively in the Web browser.

I'm focusing on raw data visualization and extraction of spike trains from raw extracellular recordings (spike sorting).


## High-performance interactive visualization

I've been developing a technology for high-performance interactive visualization of big data based on optimal use of the graphics processing unit (GPU). This technology is based on modern OpenGL (GLSL shaders) and uses techniques originally developed for 3D video games.

I'm a core developer of Vispy, a collaborative project that aims at bringing this technology to the scientific community. Vispy provides high-level, user-friendly visualization facilities that can be used by anyone with no knowledge of OpenGL.


## Python for data science

I've written [two books on Python for data science and interactive computing]({filename}/pages/books.md).
