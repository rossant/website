## Platform for large-scale electrophysiological data analysis

Next-generation electrophysiological recording devices require scalable data analysis platforms. I'm leading the development of a new [Python-based platform](http://klusta-team.github.io/) that will let scientists analyze their terabytes of data remotely and effectively in the Web browser.

I'm focusing on raw data visualization and extraction of spike trains from raw extracellular recordings (spike sorting).


## High-performance interactive visualization

I've developed a [technology for high-performance interactive visualization of big data]({filename}/pdfs/RossantHardware2013.pdf) based on optimal use of the graphics processing unit (GPU). It is based on modern OpenGL (GLSL shaders) and it uses techniques originally created for 3D video games.

I'm now a core developer of [Vispy](http://vispy.org/), a collaborative project in Python that aims at bringing to scientists high-level, user-friendly visualization facilities based on this technology.


## Big data visualization in the browser with WebGL

I'm interested in bringing closer Python and the browser closer together. More particularly, I want to bring to the browser the high-performance visualization technology that is implemented in Vispy. This will let scientists visualize huge volumes of data remotely thanks to [WebGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL), a browser-based implementation of OpenGL.


## Python for data science

I've written [two books on Python for data science and interactive computing]({filename}/pages/books.md).
