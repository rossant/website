## Platform for large-scale electrophysiological data analysis

Next-generation electrophysiological recording devices require scalable data analysis platforms. I'm leading the development of a new [Python-based platform](http://klusta-team.github.io/) that will let scientists analyze their terabytes of data remotely and effectively in the Web browser (thanks to the [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)).

I'm focusing on raw data visualization and extraction of spike trains from raw extracellular recordings (spike sorting).


## High-performance interactive visualization

I've developed a [technology for high-performance interactive visualization of big data]({filename}/pdfs/RossantHardware2013.pdf) based on optimal use of the graphics processing unit (GPU). It is based on modern OpenGL (GLSL shaders) and it uses techniques originally created for 3D video games.

I'm now a core developer of [Vispy](http://vispy.org/), a collaborative project in Python that aims at bringing to scientists high-level, user-friendly visualization facilities based on this technology.


## Big data visualization in the browser with WebGL

I'm interested in bringing closer Python and the browser closer together. More particularly, I want to bring to the browser the high-performance visualization technology that is implemented in Vispy. This will let scientists visualize huge volumes of data remotely thanks to [WebGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL), a browser-based implementation of OpenGL.


## Python for data science

I've written [two books on Python for data science and interactive computing]({filename}/pages/books.md).


## Open data

I analyze public datasets with Python and I make some data visualizations.

I gathered several data sources with IPython and pandas to create the final dataset of all accidents.
