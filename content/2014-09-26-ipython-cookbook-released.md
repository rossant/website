Title: IPython Cookbook released
Tags: python

My new book, [**IPython Interactive Computing and Visualization Cookbook**](http://ipython-books.github.io), has just been released! A sequel to my previous [beginner-level book on Python for data analysis](http://ipython.rossant.net), this new 500-page book is a **complete advanced-level guide to Python for data science**. The 100+ recipes cover not only interactive and high-performance computing topics, but also data science methods in statistics, data mining, machine learning, signal processing, image processing, network analysis, and mathematical modeling.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Here is a glimpse of the topics addressed in this book: 

* IPython notebook, **interactive widgets** in IPython 2+
* Best practices in interactive computing: version control, workflows with IPython, testing, debugging, continuous integration...
* Data analysis with pandas, NumPy/SciPy, and matplotlib
* Advanced data visualization with **seaborn, Bokeh, mpld3, d3.js, Vispy**...
* Code profiling and optimization
* High-performance computing with **Numba, Cython, GPGPU with CUDA/OpenCL, MPI, HDF5, Julia**...
* Statistical data analysis with **SciPy, PyMC, R**...
* Machine learning with **scikit-learn**
* Signal processing with SciPy, image processing with **scikit-image** and OpenCV
* Analysis of graphs and social networks with **NetworkX**
* Geographic Information Systems in Python
* Mathematical modeling: dynamical systems, symbolic mathematics with **SymPy**

All of the code is freely available as IPython notebooks on the [book's GitHub repository](https://github.com/ipython-books/cookbook-code). This repository is also the place where you can signal errata or propose improvements to any part of the book.

The book uses Python 3, although most of the code will work fine on Python 2.

You'll find the book on [Packt's website](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/ipython-interactive-computing-and-visualization-cookbook), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/IPython-Interactive-Computing-Visualization-Cookbook/dp/1783284811/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1410688253&sr=1-1), and many other bookstores.
